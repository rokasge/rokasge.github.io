    <h2>## Got covid</h2>
    <p>So I lost my covid virginity. It's not that bad. While I didn't expect to get it after so much time has passed, if I did I kind of expected it to be much worse. I think I on the 3rd day, just taking some drugs and everything is quite alright.</p>
    <h3>### Grandma</h3>
    <p>Grandma is going completely nuts. I guess it's just natural, people get old and this happens. I wouldn't like that myself though.</p>
    <h3>### Work</h3>
    <p>Even though I am sick I am still trying to work but of course it's a lot harder. I don't know, I know that what I am doing actually helps someone even if in superficial way and I like working on this project overall. I wish I could share more but that would put me in a very bad position competitevely.</p> 
    <p>Anyway, it's hard to think what to write. I need to get well asap.</p>
