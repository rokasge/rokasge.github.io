    <h2>## CPUVG 1.0 is finished. What's next?</h2>
    <p>I have finished first version of the project I was working on. I am quite satisfied with myself because it was a big project for me and I managed to code every single thing I have planned for version 1.0 and more. I didn't manage to meet the deadline I was aiming for but 4 days past the deadline is not that much especially when it was a personal project and I was learning things. During the time I was working on CPUVG1.0, I came up with new ideas for what I can implement for the next version if I decide to work on it. Some ideas for CPUVG 2.0:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Move my script to Google Drive to make it easier for the main script and Google Apps Script to work together.</li>
    <li>Google Apps script using the same data files as the main script to generate descriptions of the videos.</li>
    <li>Thumbnail maker inside the main script, thumbnails to be automatically set by Google Apps Script.</li>
    <li>Review and make a better structure of data files.</li>
    <li>Data scraper for different sites.</li>
    <li>Make a python script to generate simple web pages for displaying data - "CPUVG"/item/item-name.</li>
    <li>Review design and make changes(it can always look better): fonts, backgrounds, sections, pictures.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>While these are a lot already I just leave these for when I get back to the project, I might think of new ideas while doing other things. For now, I am going to take a break of around 2-3 months from this project because I have other stuff to do.</p>
    <h3>### What's next?</h3>
    <p>I wasn't coding for 2 years and my initial plan was to dive into web3/blockchain development. It didn't happen because as I started learning different things to refresh my memory I jumped on CPUVG which was an idea I haven't finished implementing 2 years ago. Eventually I realized that I want to do both things so I decided to spend June on CPUVG project and then, from July, to start learning web3 development and do it hard. So here I am. I had to get familiar with git again before doing anything because I don't want to lose stuff. (This website is just a HTML and CSS in Github repo.) Started playing with Truffle, web3.js, Ganache. I am new to blockchain development so everything takes a little bit of time to learn. I never had a chance to use React and from my understanding it's used very often for front-end in blockchain dev space so I am going to spend somewhat about a week really pummeling React tutorials to get the basics.</p>
    <p>List of what I am learning/learned about during this time(it's for myself so I wouldn't think that I am doing nothing): React, Redux, web3.js, JSON, Solidity, npm, node.js, Remix IDE.</p>
    <p>As I am learning I realize that there is still so much I have to learn. It's good, it's something I can channel my attention to. Got to grind it. Goodluck, future Rokas.</p>
