    <h2>## A call from grandma</h2>
    <p>I have received a call from grandma at 12:44AM and she asked me if it was me who came to her 30 minutes ago. She said that I came by with my friends(I told her that it's impossible because she knows that I only have one friend lol). They turned on TV and took her money. When I told that it wasn't me, she was very worried that some thugs got into her place and took all of her money with them. I told her not to worry and look for the money in the place that she usually keeps it. She founds it and I asked her to count it. It was all there. While the worry of losing money was gone, she was still very confused. I told her not to worry and go to sleep.</p>
    <p>I also asked my grandma if she was sleeping but she told me she was wide awake. Obviously it's dementia. It is a little bit frightening when you encounter it for the first time in your life. Doesn't really bother me that she thought it was my friends(?) that took her money. What is worrying is that her dementia will most likely just progress further and one day I will lose her.</p>
    <p>My grandma is ok. Probably more than ok. She is 88 years old. She worked most of her life in banking. While most old people get very inactive in their late years, she still gets out of bed every day and takes a bus to the summer house, taking care of 6 acre garden. She was growing flowers for as long as I remember. She was also selling them but stopped doing that several years ago. Said she didn't like being at the flower market. She still keeps growing the flowers. She isn't a very smart person and has some bad qualities but who doesn't? It felt bad when listening to her today. You don't lose a person when that person dies, you lose him or her when they lose their mind and I don't want to lose her yet.</p>
    <p>I tried to go back to working but it just shook me too much. I always find some peace when working especially when I remember G but I think I will just try to rest today. I will post an update on progress on what I am doing in several days. That's all.</p>
