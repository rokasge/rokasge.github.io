    <h2>## Be good</h2>
    <p>Well, it wasn't the best year you want to have but at least it was some sort of a conclusion. It's not a new year's resolution or something but I think I'll just try to be good as I can be from now on. I don't really have any goals anymore, everything is kind of artificial I have created in my head to be more occupied so I would think less about things that don't feel good thinking about. I don't expect anything good from life but maybe I can make people around me feel better. And maybe it's in a way selfish, you know, you make others feel better, you feel better. I don't know but that's the plan.</p>
    <p>I wasn't really working on anything much just studying and memorizing stuff. I was thinking of taking a break from university because it puts a lot on me. I am not a very smart guy and I have to study a lot to learn things, especially things I am semi-interested in.</p>
    <p>I also recovered my crypto wallet from 2016 which I thought I have lost, so I feel secure money wise. If I run out of money I can just exchange some of my savings. Maybe I can donate some of it to some good cause but at the same time it might not be a good idea.</p>
    <p>I want to walk more. Sometimes it makes me feel good. Working out is boring but makes you feel better later. Walking, sometimes I really enjoy it. Maybe I should go to some other city and do long walks.</p>
    <p>Also writing but more consistent, some kind of essay writing. I try to write essays sometimes but I run into a lot of problems doing it so it's just some kind of a hobby thing.</p>
    <p>To add some competition I should also turn this 1% into 0.1% next year =]</p>

    <p>I don't know. For now I just want to chill, work-out a little, walk, be unbothered, in my lane and just be good. </p>
