    <h2>## October 8 Update</h2>
    <h3>### General</h3>
    <p>It's been something like two months now. I have no real excuses for not writing. I was quite busy because when im working on something im more focused on what I am working on than thinking about reality. In the past I liked writing to my friends and especially the girl I liked but none of them are present in my life anymore so it feels like I am writing to nobody, maybe myself.</p>
    
    <h3>### Duolingo</h3>
    <p>I've advanced to the diamond league in Duolingo and received the hardest achievement, the legendary one. It was hard, especially going through the leagues because it takes time and people there are very competetive. I didn't learn that much language but now I know better ways to do so. Chasing after achievements is not it. I am focusing on learning instead of achievements as I have most of them now.<br>

    <h3>### CPUVG</h3>
    <p>I made some progress with my Youtube channel and since July I went from 64 views in 48 hours to what's in the picture. I learned some things, learned what I was doing wrong and what I was doing right. I started coding a new project about which I will talk in more detail sometime later.</p>

    <h3>### Other Things</h3>
    <p>So I am back to studying law for the second year. I also got a certificate in IT. The course to get the certificate was really taking up much time. I am not sure what was the certificate for but I believe it is better to do something than nothing. It also helps with dealing with thoughts of guilt and regret. I don't know what else to do about it besides trying to do my best of whatever I am doing.</p>
