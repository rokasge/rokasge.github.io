    <h2>## November 6</h2>
    <h3>### General</h3>
    <p>University... I don't really like it but I joined to get some structure into my life. Basically overworking myself so I wouldn't feel as sad. Sometimes it takes a lot of time. Even today, I just finished preparing for administrative law test. Really makes you tired.</p>
    
    <h3>### Duolingo</h3>
    <p>I am still doing Duolingo. I took a break from russian language. I thought that if I am learning a language I can at least learn something that I like and after looking over the languages I started learning greek. I am constantly doing some learning everyday, sometimes writing words from the lessons on paper. At the moment it's a complete hobby but maybe if some of my projects are more successful I could move to Greece for a year or something. Who knows.<br>

    <h3>### TC 1.0</h3>
    <p>I finished the barebones of the website and added some data. Yes, TC is a website part of a larger project. It will integrate with another part of the project, which I don't have the name for yet but it's a continuation of CPUVG. While I enjoy doing some parts of it, it's not all fun but I want some financial stability and this is a good and safe way to go for it. If everything works out, I wouldn't have to think about money for some years. It would also create not only a financial but structural foundation to do something new.</p>

    <h3>### Working out</h3>
    <p>I often start to work out but quit after a few days so I don't write about it. I don't like writing about things that you attempt to do but for some reasons decide not to. I think it's good to try out new things but things that you can stick with are the important ones. So for about two months I have been doing quite a lot of working out and I think it's showing. I think I am feeling better physically and I guess look better. Not sure who I can impress with it but you know I am still an ugly man. The only woman who I would like to impress is long gone. But I guess it won't hurt to be more physically fit...</p>

    <h3>### XVE</h3>
    <p>Another money-focused project. This thing I thought of when I was working on TC but it's a completely seperate thing. I believe it could be very profitable and I did some sketching and stuff but at the moment I am trying to focus my time(or whatever is left of it after I am done with my studying) on finishing TC+the_other_thing_that_is_a_continuation_of_CPUVG. This is like a note to not forget about this. I kind of want to start working on this right now but I want to also finish some stuff, and I can't finish university right now or learn greek instantly, so this will get priority when I am finished with TC and continuation of CPUVG.</p>

    <h3>Thing I like about myself</h3>
    <p>Even if I am down I think of these things. Other people say that overthinking is bad. I love overthinking, it's just that overthinking about things that didn't work out don't feel good. If things worked out differently in the past, my overthinking would be 100% positive and it still brings positives in my life as I don't know what I would do if I couldn't overthink some ideas and come up with ridiculous plans how to implement it. It feels good when you overcome real obstacles that nobody thought of to reach the goal of implementing something. I don't know if I consider myself enterpreneurship like because after working with some startups I realized that the company leaders are just going around, talking like they are the next Apple and begging for money. I don't really like that. If some idea requires more investment I will put it aside for when I complete smaller projects. My thinking was always to do something with what you have, not try to conquer the world with what you don't have. Meh, enough writing, time to go to sleep.</p>
